And one of these items is a large sword that looks very familiar. So what is this familiar sword and did DC and Warner Bros. Discovery manage to obtain the rights to use it in its upcoming superhero flick?</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-buster-sword-and-is-it-really-in-blue-beetle data-injectable=false>What is the Buster Sword and is it really in Blue Beetle?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>During the final moments of&nbsp;Blue Beetle‘s trailer, the superhero was able to manifest a giant sword that looks oddly familiar, with the beetle complimenting Reyes, saying that this weapon is a “nice choice.” The reason why the weapon is giving off familiar vibes is because it somewhat resembles the Buster Sword in&nbsp;Final Fantasy.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>In the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy</a>&nbsp;video game series, the Buster Sword is Cloud Strife’s trademark weapon and first appeared in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy VII</a>. This broadsword weapon is massive in size and has appeared in other games such as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Smash Bros.</a>, and&nbsp;Ehrgeiz: God Bless the Ring.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>While the sword does look familiar in terms of appearance, it is not the same sword that was featured in the Blue Beetle trailer. Sure, it has some similarities ,but if you look very closely, the weapon has some noticeable differences in its design to ensure it’s not ripping off Square Enix and the game’s creator, Hironobu Sakaguchi.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=false>Large swords that subtly reference popular video games are just one of many weapons the Blue Beetle suit can create. More will be revealed once the film comes out in theaters on Aug 18, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK2tHnToZxmmqWowaa%2BjKyuqKqUYq6vsIyiqmahpGK%2Fpq3LpbBmoZ5ir63BxGaZnp2kobJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-blake.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Blake Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</span></a>
