<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Terminator Salvation movie review (2009)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#>Christian Bale</a> plays the role of Connor, in a movie that raises many questions about the lines between man and machine. Raises them, and then leaves them levitating. However, it has many fights between a humanoid cyborg and robotic Skynet men made of steel. How do these antagonists fight? Why, with their fists, of course, which remains a wonderfully cinematic device. They also shoot at each other, to little effect. In fact, one metal man is covered in molten ore and then flash-frozen, and keeps on tickin'. And listen, Skynet buddies, what Bale thought about that cameraman is only the tip of the iceberg compared to what he thinks about you.</p><p>There is nothing visible in this world but a barren wasteland. No towns, no houses, no food, no farms, no nothing. Maybe they live on Spam. The resistance is run from a submarine commanded by Gen. Ashdown (<a href=#>Michael Ironside</a>), who wants to destroy Skynet and all of its human POWs. Connor, who is not even human, vows to save them. Wait. That's Marcus Wright (<a href=#>Sam Worthington</a>), the guy from the past, who looks so much like Connor that maybe he only thinks he's Wright. Marcus is a convicted murderer from the past, awakened from cryogenic sleep.</p><p>I know with a certainty approaching dread that all of my questions will be explained to me in long detailed messages from "Terminator" experts. They also will charge me with not seeing the movie before I reviewed it. Believe me, I would have enjoyed traveling forward through time for two hours, starting just before I saw the movie. But in regard to the answers to my questions: You know what? <i>I don't care.</i></p><p>The first "Terminator" movie I regret (I suppose) I did not see. "<a href=#>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a>" (1991) was a fairly terrific movie, set in the (then) future, to prevent the nuclear holocaust of 1997. You remember that. It was <i>about something.</i> In it, <a href=#>Edward Furlong</a> was infinitely more human as John Connor than<br>Christian Bale is in this film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tnKulmaOutbvRZqqapKaWwaq7zWZpaWhp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marry-my-husband-episode-5-release-date-confirmed.html><span>←</span><span>Marry My Husband episode 5 release date confirmed</span></a>
