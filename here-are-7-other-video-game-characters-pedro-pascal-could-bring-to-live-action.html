Admittedly, some of these picks are a little on the silly side, and a bit of fun, but others could genuinely benefit from Pascal’s talents.</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>So, without further ado, here are seven video game characters that Pedro Pascal could bring to life.</p><h2 id=h-big-boss-metal-gear-solid data-injectable=false>Big Boss – Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/big-boss-metal-gear-solid.png><p data-characters=823 data-current-count=823 data-injectable=true>We realize there are a few holes with this casting but hear us out. Yes, Oscar Isaac has already signed on to play Solid Snake in a Metal Gear Solid film adaptation, and that character is meant to be a clone of Big Boss, so if and when that movie releases, turns out to be a success, and justifies the creation of the prequel, then in staying true to the source material, Oscar Isaac should reprise the role. However, there’s no denying that Pascal can pull off the morally conflicted gun for hire – and we can see him donning the iconic camo gear and eye patch as he treks his way through Tselinoyarsk. Alternatively, if we want to stay as true as possible, we could reunite the real-life pals and get Pascal in as either Revolver Ocelot or Kaz Miller, provided we’re adapting the events of Metal Gear Solid V.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>John Marston – Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/john-marston-red-dead-redemption.png><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=811 data-injectable=true>Pascal’s two most prominent roles involve being what is essentially a space cowboy, as well as a tragic father figure who would go to any length to protect his family, so the actor portraying John Marston (during the original Red Dead Redemption, and not the sequel) is a shoe that fits quite easily considering the character’s arc in the events of the first game. He’s brutal when he needs to be but shows his heart when it matters. We can already see ourselves shedding a tear during the epilogue.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>John Lugo – Spec Ops: The Line</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/john-lugo-spec-ops-the-line.png><p data-characters=548 data-current-count=848 data-injectable=true>Concocting Pedro Pascal as Spec Ops: The Line’s John Lugo would involve the actor bringing a healthy dash of the charisma he brought to Oberyn Martell in Game of Thrones, the stoicism of Din Djarin in The Mandalorian, and the emotional baggage of Joel in The Last of Us. What we get is a wisecracking soldier who will reluctantly follow sketchy orders but make clear the direction in which his moral compass is facing. Given the heavy subject matter of the game, Pascal is the perfect candidate to portray Lugo on his way to his devastating fate.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Nathan Drake – Uncharted</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nathan-drake-uncharted.png><p data-characters=649 data-current-count=949 data-injectable=true>If Pedro nailed one Naughty Dog franchise, why not another? From the get-go, let’s make it clear that we’re talking about an Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End-age Nathan Drake. Let’s be honest, Yes, Pascal is arguably at his best when portraying brooding, dramatic characters, but he has proven he is also capable of playing charismatic wisecracking type in Game of Thrones. Tom Holland was a fine, if not an average casting choice for the lead in the other enormous Naughty Dog franchise, but we just didn’t find a young Nathan Drake story all that interesting. In any case, if Nathan Fillion is unavailable, get on the phone to Pedro.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Max Payne</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/max-payne.png><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>Pedro Pascal as a scorned New York cop who goes on the hunt for the people who murdered his family (or whichever part of his saga a studio would adapt) is most certainly something that we could buy. If not his tenure as a cop, then his life as a bodyguard and mercenary are certainly a good fit, considering his typecasting as the protector of important figures.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Alan Wake</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/alan-wake.png><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>A bestselling writer struggling with writer’s block whose wife goes missing, and needs to go toe to toe with all things supernatural to get to the bottom of the mystery? Yes please, let’s get Pedro in there. We can already hear the actor delivering Wake’s voiceovers, and see him shining his torch left and right to keep the evils of the night at bay.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Chris Redfield – Resident Evil</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chris-redfield-resident-evil.png><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=false>If we wanted to see <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pedro Pascal go full John Wick-mode</a> in a zombie-themed franchise with less of a focus on drama, why not plonk him into Resident Evil? He’s a man with brown hair, which pretty much seems to be the only prerequisite required to bring life to one of the series’ most iconic characters. Granted, live-action Resident Evil adaptations have a track record of being average at best, and Pascal doesn’t seem to ever touch B-grade stuff.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZon56qlWKus7GMcGSorJiav27CyJ2cqGWXlrqmecKhmKuZk6mys7%2BMqZydqp9ivaK%2FwpqjZpufqrmlecGroKefXam8brjIr5xmmZOptrC6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bbc-the-lady-vanishes-only-strengthens-reputation-of-hitchcock-original.html><span>←</span><span>BBC The Lady Vanishes Only Strengthens Reputation of Hitchcock Original | Features</span></a>
