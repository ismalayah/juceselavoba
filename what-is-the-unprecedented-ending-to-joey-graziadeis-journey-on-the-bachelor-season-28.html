Keep scrolling to find out for yourself…</p><h2 id=h-how-does-the-bachelor-season-28-end data-injectable=false>How does The Bachelor season 28 end?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>“Yesterday I heard for the first time all season what that ‘unprecedented ending’ that the show is hyping up could possibly be,” he prefaced in a post titled <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bachelor Joey – Episode 6 Thoughts, What I Heard Yesterday, & Does Screen Time Equal Winning?</a> prior to sharing the specifics.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>While we were all hoping that he would paint the full picture, Reality Steve said that he “finally was able to hear what the&nbsp;gist&nbsp;was in regards to this ending that’s ‘unprecedented,'” however, he still does not have all of the nitty gritty details:</p><p>“I was told what the general idea was behind what Joey’s talking about and the show hyping it up, but, it only brought more questions to me than answers, and you know me, I like having most (if not all) of every detail I can get before I give you what I’ve heard. Especially since we’re over a month away from the finale… I can’t share what it is I’ve heard yet because I’ll be bombarded with questions I don’t have answers to. I literally just heard from sources the idea of what Joey and the show are talking about, and it makes sense to me what it is. I just don’t know how it fits in with everything else given the 2 min trailer in the first episode that shows Joey standing at the altar, crying, then leaving, taking off his jacket, talking to production, etc. I wanna fill those holes in before I can tell what I heard.”</p><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>For those who have yet to hear who secures Joey’s final rose and a stunning Neil Lane sparkler, Reality Steve reported a while back that the final rose ceremony occurs in Tulum, Mexico and will come down to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelsey Anderson</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daisy Kent</a>. Admitting that it is “always tough to get any details in regards to how the dates with the parents went or who had which date first and stuff like that,” he revealed that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daisy wins the hit competition show</a> nonetheless, and the two lovebirds are engaged as of February 2024.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>The Bachelor know-it-all also confirmed that this never-been-seen-before ending “certainly plays a role in the end result of Joey and Daisy ending up engaged,” however, the conclusion of season 28 remained the same regardless:</p><p>“If what I heard is right, which I believe it is, it’s definitely something we’ve never seen before. They aren’t lying about that, however, is it so mind blowing and earth shattering like they’re making it out to be? I mean, not really, but it doesn’t mean it isn’t important. It certainly plays a role in the end result of Joey and Daisy ending up engaged, and I find it interesting, but it’s tough to go along with the hype the show’s giving it only because it&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;change anything about the ending. It’s more about how we got to that point.”</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>“As soon as I know more details, since I have more questions now, I’ll fill you in,” Reality Steve concluded passionately, and it is safe to say that we will be checking his socials every single day until further notice to be the first to find out how The Bachelor ends.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=false>Until then, catch brand new episodes&nbsp;every Monday on ABC — or stream them the following day via Hulu — to watch Joey’s love story come to a close.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXam1pnnUp6ernZOasaa6056bZp2embavs4ytpmain5rGbrPRmrGimZSatrR5yaisq6aVrnqwuoytn55lkpawqbHLqKlmq5WWwLC6jGtvaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-elliot-grainge-what-to-know-about-sofia-richies-fiance.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Elliot Grainge?
