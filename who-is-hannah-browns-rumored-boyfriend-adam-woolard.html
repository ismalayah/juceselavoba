That same day, the former Bachelorette posted her own video to her Instagram story that showed her cozying up to a mystery man that fans believed was Woolard, according to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. Then, in January 2021, the two seemingly confirmed their romance when the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> photographed them holding hands during a stroll in LA. Although Hannah's new man may be new to fame, he is certainly used to being photographed. The 6'1" hottie works as a model for <a href=#>The Campbell Agency</a>. And according to his <a href=#>private Instagram account</a>, he's not just a pretty face. Woolard is also a meditation and lifestyle coach.</p><p>Fans are definitely hyped that Hannah has found happiness with her new love, especially after she said in a November 2020 <a href=#>Youtube video</a>, "I think I am truly ready to give and receive love again, but it definitely has been a journey." We wish you all the best, girl!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGlpa354e9ahpmaho2K1orrNmp9mmqKkxK%2B%2FjKuspqeimrFurs6ynauhlaOxbq3DmqRmr5%2BkuaK%2Bw2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./list-of-items-in-pok-c3-a9mon-conquest.html><span>←</span><span>List of items in Pokmon Conquest</span></a>
