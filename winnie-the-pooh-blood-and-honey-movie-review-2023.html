<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey movie review (2023)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The best joke is that you see Pooh's round ears and button-nose&nbsp;in ominous shots where Leatherface or Michael Myers are supposed to be, with red overalls and a rubbery mask that's frozen to a type of honey-suckling grin. Judging from the mildly amused reactions of other people in the theater, those reveals are the film's most consistent chuckles, and I agree. You never get tired of seeing Frake-Waterfield's version of Pooh and Piglet (portrayed by <a href=#>Craig David Dowsett</a> and <a href=#>Chris Cordell</a>, respectively)&nbsp;pitched as towering psychopaths, but the movie&nbsp;also makes you wish it tried harder.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>"Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey" struggles to be notable outside of its irreverent IP comic relief, despite simplifying itself. Take away the Pooh and Piglet stuff, and you have a ho-hum stalker thriller that treats its one-dimensional characters as punchlines for gory scenes its budget can't fully deliver on. In this case, five women&nbsp;(<a href=#>Maria Taylor</a>, <a href=#>Natasha Tosini</a>, <a href=#>Natasha Rose Mills</a>, <a href=#>Amber Doig-Thorne</a>, and <a href=#>Danielle Ronald</a>) have gathered at a remote cabin near Pooh and Piglet's kingdom of sadism. Frake-Waterfield doesn't even humor us with much development or care for these women; we know that one of them, Maria Taylor's Maria, is traumatized by a man who stalks her back in the city, and this is her getaway. "Blood and Honey"&nbsp;then lumps her in with other&nbsp;easy targets for easier shocks: the women are as gullible as&nbsp;anyone deeply offended by this movie, and we're meant to laugh at each poor choice these characters make.&nbsp;</p><p>A sentence I never thought I'd write: Pooh and Piglet proceed to terrorize these women, with a few other victims thrown in, sometimes in a way akin to ritual sacrifice.&nbsp;It only becomes uneasy when it becomes so&nbsp;obvious. It's a lot of women—many with black hair, curiously—experiencing head trauma. Oh, bother.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Whether one finds this movie's promise&nbsp;giddy or gross, the terror scenes are much too drawn out, stuffed with extraneous beats that create dead air. There are many improvised-looking of scenes of stalking or screaming for help, in which everyone is stuck waiting for a greater storytelling vision to round out the joke. One scene that lacks self-awareness has Piglet walking in a shallow indoor pool, wielding a sledgehammer at his prey. A funny set-up, but the scene itself can barely move. The whole project has that baffling defect—how do you cut a premise like this down to the bone, with Pooh and Piglet more or less rampaging for 85 minutes, and make the movie so boring?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46woKemmZp6tbTEZqeop5hir627zp1kmqaUYrWwusSyZKanpp6ybr7Er6Cer11nfXN%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sophia-diggs-a-rising-star.html><span>←</span><span>Sophia Diggs: A Rising Star In The Tech Industry</span></a>
