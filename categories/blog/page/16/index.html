Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old Macheath, babe
And he keeps it out of sight
You know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears old Macheath, babe
So there’s never, never a trace of red
Now on the sidewalk, ooh, sunny morning, uh-huh
Lies a body just oozin’ life</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jean Potvin Of NY Islanders Dead At 72: How Did The NHL Defenseman Die? His Cause Of Death Explored</h2><time>Aug 1, 2024</time>
