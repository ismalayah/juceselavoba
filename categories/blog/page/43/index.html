HBO’s The Last of Us series, based on the wildly popular PlayStation game of the same name from Naughty Dog, premiered on January 15 with “When You’re Lost in the Darkness.” Launching with a 99 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, showrunner Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog Co-President Neil Druckmann’s live-action adaptation seemed to be a hit with the crowd, who were understandably skeptical as to whether or not theirs would be a faithful rendition of the critically acclaimed franchise.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Mario Selman Gay?

<a href=../../../../collateral-beauty-review.html></a>
Hollywood has no problem forcing&nbsp;emotional pornography upon drama-hungry audiences, but even compared to the most shallow tearjerkers,&nbsp;Collateral Beauty is f*#king savage. Like, rips-your-heart-out-and-eats-it-in-front-of-you savage. Writer&nbsp;Allan Loeb&nbsp;wants to make you cry, but only through the most superficial, disconnected emotional means possible. Think “Chicken Soup For No One’s Soul,” with a recipe that tosses every gut-wrenching soap opera subplot into a lukewarm, neglected stew. You might bawl, but you’ll also feel abused by scripted sledgehammers that only act as a sullen onslaught of morose sadness undeserving of your investment.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Funimate Star | Celebrity Phone Numbers</h2><time>May 8, 2024</time>

When it comes to manga and anime, especially the fantasy side of it all, there are many places we have to suspend our disbelief in order for it to work. Anime like One Piece very much falls into this category, and though the story has plenty of unique details, it does do one thing that is very commonly found across many anime of a similar genre, and the live-action has opted to keep it in too.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>In Defense Of: Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers (1988)</h2><time>May 7, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../defense-halloween-4-return-michael-myers-1988.html></a>
Recommended Videos That’s not to say that certain shades of the character don’t feel familiar, like the dark sense of humor he occasionally seems to have seen when Meeker’s daughter Kelly (Kathleen Kinmont) approaches what she believes to be a deputy rocking in a chair that turns out to be Michael, or how he breaks into the Lloyd home to search for evidence confirming Jamie is his niece. But some of the more over the top elements – paired with a woefully goofy-looking new mask, as well as an infamous blonde-haired one that appears in a random shot late in the film – don’t fully gel to make this version of Michael feel like the one who kickstarted the franchise.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Erica Mokay Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Family, Kalamazoo, Salary and Net Worth</h2><time>May 6, 2024</time>
