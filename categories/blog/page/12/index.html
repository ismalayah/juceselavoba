The best joke is that you see Pooh's round ears and button-nose&nbsp;in ominous shots where Leatherface or Michael Myers are supposed to be, with red overalls and a rubbery mask that's frozen to a type of honey-suckling grin. Judging from the mildly amused reactions of other people in the theater, those reveals are the film's most consistent chuckles, and I agree. You never get tired of seeing Frake-Waterfield's version of Pooh and Piglet (portrayed by Craig David Dowsett and Chris Cordell, respectively)&nbsp;pitched as towering psychopaths, but the movie&nbsp;also makes you wish it tried harder.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>George Folsey Jr movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>
