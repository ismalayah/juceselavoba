Anime like <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Piece</a></strong> very much falls into this category, and though the story has plenty of unique details, it does do one thing that is very commonly found across many anime of a similar genre, and the live-action has opted to keep it in too.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>One of the biggest tropes found in fantasy manga/anime is the need for characters to call out their moves in the middle of a fight, which in real life would be a horrendous fighting method as it tells your opponent what you are about to do, allowing them to counter it. One Piece has many of its own, and, given just how daft the series can be, some of them are pretty out there.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true>Our protagonist Luffy, shouts out many <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that are related to his rubbery-like body</a>. One such attack is Gomu Gomu no Pistol (ゴムゴムの銃ピストル) which literally translates to Rubber Rubber Pistol/Gun. When adapted for live-action, many anime drop this trope as it can often slow down the action scenes, but the One Piece live-action opted to keep it in, with one key exception.</p><p data-characters=681 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>The Netflix adaption <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has been one of the best-received live-action adaptions of an anime</a> in a long time. For many, this has to do with the fact that it kept much of the story’s heart and silliness, never taking itself too seriously paying homage to the anime as a whole rather than cherry-picking. The characters call out their moves and the fight scenes are over the top and crazy, which we love to see from such a fun, energetic series. The exception then, comes in the form of Zoro, a character who, in the manga, is the biggest culprit for calling out his moves, with some ridiculously long names, but in the live-action prefers to just attack his opponents straight on.</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=97 data-injectable=false>Over on Reddit an OP started a conversation on this topic, asking fellow fans what they thought.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false><a href=#>How do you feel about “All great fighters call out their finishing moves” in the live action series?</a><br>by in<a href=#>OnePiece</a></figure><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>This user doesn’t care what other people say, in the One Piece world this is right.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by from discussion<a href=#></a><br>in<a href=#>OnePiece</a></figure><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>This could serve as a gateway for non-anime fans, or Western audiences in general, to get on board with this style of storytelling.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by from discussion<a href=#></a><br>in<a href=#>OnePiece</a></figure><p data-characters=117 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Many are very on board with Zoro not calling out his attacks, especially given how weird they would sound in English.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by from discussion<a href=#></a><br>in<a href=#>OnePiece</a></figure><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>There are other difficulties as well, which this user points out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by from discussion<a href=#></a><br>in<a href=#>OnePiece</a></figure><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false>Another shared one of Zoro’s infamously long attack names, and honestly… this could potentially slow down the pacing.
