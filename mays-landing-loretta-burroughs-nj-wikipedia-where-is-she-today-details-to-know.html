Instead, their relationship fell apart pretty soon while they were living together in Mays Landing, New Jersey.</p><p>Loretta’s husband Daniel, 66, vanished all of a sudden in 2007 but she was calm claiming her husband had ran away to Florida with another woman while asked by the police officials.</p><p>While his families were filing a missing person report in 2007 and even setting up a Facebook page in 2010 to find Daniel, Loretta was busy selling the belongings of Daniel, including the house she shared with him. During that time she had divorced Daniel as well.</p><p>Loretta, who had a history of convictions, was searched by the Atlantic county police on her Ventnor home for an unrelated case in 2013 which revealed the horror she had been accountable for years.</p><h2 id=who-is-loretta-burroughs-first-husband><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-loretta-burroughs-first-husband></span> Who Is Loretta Burroughs First Husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Loretta Burroughs’s first husband had passed away when she met Daniel after several years.</p><p>During that time, her high-school sweetheart Daniel had suffered a divorce with his first wife.</p><p>Both Loretta and Daniel had 4 children from their previous marriage. Loretta was blessed with 4 grandchildren as well.</p><p>Fast forward after their marriage, Loretta stabbed Daniel to death in August 2007 on their New Jersey home.</p><p>Loretta’s husband Daniel suffered a horrific death but was never rested. She left his dead body on bathtub for days before cutting off his body.</p><p>She placed his body parts on plastic containers and his head on a handbag. Loretta took his dead body in her new house every time she moved.</p><p>Police found his decomposed remains on plastic containers inside a closet of her house’s guest bedroom in Ventnor.</p><h2 id=where-is-loretta-burroughs-today><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-loretta-burroughs-today></span> Where Is Loretta Burroughs Today?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Loretta Burroughs is placed on Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women in Clinton, New Jersey.</p><p>She was arrested on May, 2013, and was sentenced to 55-years in prison for the murder and a concurrent three-year term for hindering apprehension.</p><p>Loretta was 63 when she was found guilty in 2015.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWRrsBuuMCnm6Kml2K5sL7ErauaZZKqv7O71KCfrGWen3q4tcqip56cmZZ6uLTEq5xmoaNiwKmxjK2mnZmpYrGmwMCio6xlpKR6rLrOsGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abella-danger-biography-wiki-age-career-family-facts-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Abella Danger Age, Height, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth, Photos, Videos</span></a>
