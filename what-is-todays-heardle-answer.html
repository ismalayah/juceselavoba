Except you’re not guessing words, you’re guessing songs.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>Plucked from what is described as a “long list of popular tracks”, each day presents a new song and each day encourages keen-eared fans to guess its title from just its introduction.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>Heardle isn’t going to throw any obscure B-sides your way, but guessing popular songs from intros alone is by no means an easy feat.

If you guess the right artist, but the wrong song, the text will turn yellow, letting you know that the W is within reach.</p><p>Don’t worry — just like Wordle, you can still share your victory and clog everyone’s feeds with yellow and green squares as per.</p><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=139 data-injectable=false>But what’s the answer to today’s Heardle?
