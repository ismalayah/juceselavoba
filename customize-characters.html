Let's find out.</p><p><span>First Published April 21, 2023, 14:10</span></p><p>Ever since Dead Island 2 launched globally, many players have been curious about whether they can customize their in-game characters. In <a href=#>Dead Island 2</a>, you can select between six playable characters called <a href=#>Slayers</a> at the beginning. Each slayer has unique attributes and skills that you can use to survive the Zombie apocalypse.</p><p>Besides this, a lot of players love to personalize their characters' appearance to give them a unique look. But is it possible to customize characters in Dead Island 2? Let's find out.</p><h2>Does Dead Island 2 Allow Character Customization?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/_o8HwEbAeRFadiOLZWecAIARnGhjZGYU9eT1CY3Fhhw/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9kZWFkX2lzbGFuZF8yL2RlYWQvZGVhZC1pc2xhbmQtMi1zbGF5ZXJzLWFteS53ZWJw><p><strong>The simple answer is no. </strong>Dead Island 2 doesn't allow its players to modify character appearance in the game. As a result, you have to stick around with your character’s physical appearance, designed by the game developers.</p><p>At the same time, it's worth noting that the <a href=#>Deluxe and Gold Editions</a> of Dead Island 2 come with two Character Packs, namely Character Pack 1 and Character Pack 2. These packs contain costumes for the characters "Silver Star Jacob" and "Cyber Slayer Amy," respectively.</p><p>Although the included weapons are available to all slayers, the costumes are exclusive to their respective characters. Four more Character Packs will probably be released in the future, providing each character with a unique outfit. Although this may not offer full customization options, it gives players more choices for their character's appearance.</p><p>Finally, Dead Island 2 allows you to incorporate more skills into your character by <a href=#>using skill cards</a>. Dead Island 2 will initially enable you to utilize only two skill slots. However, you'll unlock more slots as you advance through the game. You can replace the cards in your skill deck whenever you want, and there's no extra charge.</p><p>So there you have it. That's everything you need to know about character customization in Dead Island 2.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/HvqktvLkiEtemZ0byb0cfAHVThLK_Wjw0eqtoONg70Y/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy82MDNmYWJjYmUyMDM1NWM2MGMwZGJjNmU5MTcwMTZhYTI1MGRkZTdjLTIwMHgyMDAud2VicA alt="Tarun Sayal" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Written by <a href=#>Tarun Sayal</a></h3><p>Experienced freelance gaming writer with five years of experience covering a wide range of gaming topics.
