After a vocal section, Slushii moves things forward with hard hitting drops, complete with squelchy basslines and crashing beats.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=206 data-injectable=false><strong>Slushii</strong>‘s rework is a definite fan pleaser and probably the most solid effort on the remix collection.
