No other names for Superman have been leaked at this time apart from other names, like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a Euphoria star</a>, who never made it to the current stage of discussions. However, the rumored list for the role of Lois is a bit longer with names like Emma Mackey, Phoebe Dynevor, Rachel Brosnahan, and Samara Weaving in the mix, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brosnahan as the top runner</a> because of a great audition even though her age remains a question as Gunn will be depicting a young Superman.</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>In addition, Nicholas Hoult’s name is circulating the internet as the choice for Lex Luthor. However, Gunn has made it abundantly clear that he is not a big fan of leaking who made the cut for Superman: Legacy. While he did confirm one person has been cast so far, he didn’t share a name, and judging what he said before that, we will be in the dark for a long time before someone offers official news of the casting.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>For all of you asking, I would never comment on who is or isn’t AUDITIONING for a role. That’s the actor’s business only & isn’t something I’d make public unless they did it first after the fact (like <a href=#>@GlennHowerton</a> or <a href=#>@ZacharyLevi</a> having auditioned for Star-Lord & being top…</p>— James Gunn (@JamesGunn) <a href=#>May 13, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>But even though Gunn refused to serve fodder for the ongoing Legacy chatter, fans still found enough ammunition to kickstart another discussion. Forget about Superman for a moment. What would the world be like if Glenn Howerton or Zachary Levi had been chosen to play Star-Lord? Chris Pratt’s life would most likely be a lot different. That’s for sure.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Imagining an alternate universe with either <a href=#>@GlennHowerton</a> or <a href=#>@ZacharyLevi</a> as Star-Lord is such a fun thought, and it really makes me appreciate this world of ridiculously talented people we have.</p>— Shaun (@shaunpmartin) <a href=#>May 13, 2023</a><p data-characters=75 data-current-count=75 data-injectable=false>The mention of Glenn Howerton has quite a few fans triggered at the moment.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We need Glenn Howerton in the DCU… somewhere… Anywhere… But possibly… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RMJIsLrC66</a></p>— Tom 🇮🇪🎮 (@FUNKYT0WN49) <a href=#>May 13, 2023</a><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>Coming back to the Legacy casting reports, some simply ditched the possibilities and instead went with who they want in the film. Well, they might be able to actually do a good job at casting if James Gunn would only give them a chance.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I can see the following James Gunn regulars in the following roles:</p><p>Sly Stallone as Superman’s birth father, Jor-El.<br>Michael Rooker as Pa Kent.<br>Nathan Fillion as Perry White.<br>Pete Davidson as Jimmy Olsen.</p><p>Superman & Lois will be a big surprise!</p>— Gonzalo Del Rio ✶ ✶ ✶ ✶ (@gonzalodelriov) <a href=#>May 13, 2023</a><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Regardless of what Gunn said, there are fans who will still fight for at least some part of the rumors to be true.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Emma Mackey as Lois Lane please 🙏🏼 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Zrscyh8Y5e</a></p>— Zero (@zerowontmiss) <a href=#>May 13, 2023</a><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>As Gunn hasn’t refuted the report, it has to be one of those reverse psychology tricks and the DC boss knows how to use it very well on his fanbase. He says “no” and the fans go nuts with their guesses, stirring that bowl of chaotic soup until it’s time to reveal what was going on all along behind DC Films’ closed doors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooZqllah6qMHNp2Sdp5Wou7V51pqqrZ1dlru6edOipJ5lkZmxs7HSrKCnn12XvK6u0qGcpaRdqMKxsdGmmKdlnJq0oq%2FYZpqaq6Seu6h50Z6nqKqkqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christopher-schwarzenegger.html><span>←</span><span>Is Arnold Schwarzenegger's Son, Christopher Schwarzenegger Dating?
