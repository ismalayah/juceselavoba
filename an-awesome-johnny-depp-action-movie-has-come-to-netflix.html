Sure, he’s been in plenty of movies with action in them, but we’re talking old school shoot-em-ups that don’t revolve around mystical MacGuffins or CGI creatures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MV5BMTgyNzgzOTA4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkxNjUyMw@@._V1_-640x360.jpg><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=729 data-injectable=true>Ironically, his last foray into that particular territory came just two months after Jack Sparrow exploded onto the scene, with Robert Rodriguez’s Once Upon a Time in Mexico hitting theaters in September 2003. The sequel to Desperado, Antonio Banderas’ El Mariachi and Salma Hayek’s Carolina are on the hunt for Willem Dafoe’s cartel kingpin, but Depp’s corrupt CIA agent Sands is hot on their tail.</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=false>It’s a wonderfully self-deprecating turn from Depp, who pitches his performance just on the right side of self-awareness, with the dual-wielding Sands literally sporting a t-shirt that has ‘C.I.A’ emblazoned on it in huge letters. Given the star’s continued popularity, Once Upon a Time in Mexico looks destined for a decent position on Netflix’s most-watched list now that it’s available to stream on the platform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKdlkayytLvMnmSjp5iju7p5w56nqWWRmMGqu81mpKiumZp6qa3SZpqopZViwbB5zZ6rn6SZrXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roosevelt-leftwich-fox-8-bio-wiki-age-height-weight-loss-nationality-wife-married-ohio-university-salary-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Roosevelt Leftwich (FOX 8) Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight Loss, Nationality, Wife, Married, Ohio Uni</span></a>
