There’s still much we don’t know about the Captain Marvel sequel, however, including the nature of Zawe Ashton’s mystery villain.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>Despite the Captain Marvel mythos arguably not being one that’s overly familiar to non-hardcore comic book readers, the studio likes to keep the characters of these films under wraps ahead of time, to surprise the fans who do know the lore intimately when they hit cinemas. For example, Jude Law turning out to be the evil Yon-Rogg and Annette Bening being a gender-flipped Mar-Vell in Captain Marvel.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Marvel seems to be pulling a similar trick in The Marvels, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashton has long been rumored</a> to be playing another previously male character from the source material. Namely, Kree general Dar-Benn. But who is this character and how will they fit into the Brie Larson-starring sequel?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-dar-benn-in-the-marvel-universe data-injectable=false>Who is Dar-Benn in the Marvel universe?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dar-benn-marvel-1.jpg><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>In the comics, Dar-Benn was a treacherous and power-hungry Kree military leader who partnered with fellow Kree Ael-Dan to assassinate their people’s current (incompetent, to be fair) leader and rule in their place. They even created a robotic Silver Surfer to do the deed — an interesting Fantastic Four connection for those waiting to see the First Family in the MCU — and framed the murder on the Skrulls.</p><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>Dar-Benn is an extremely minor player in Marvel Comics history, with the 616 incarnation of the character having a total of two appearances to his name. Expect The Marvels to totally revamp Dar-Benn from top to bottom, then, with the shift in gender likely being the least important change. Although, thanks to the trailer, it looks like we can expect the concept of Dar-Benn leading a coup and taking over as Kree ruler to be retained. It appears that Ashton’s villain has usurped Ronan the Accuser’s position at the head of the Kree army.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Looks like Zawe Ashton’s character has taken up Ronan the Accuser’s post at the head of a Kree army. The Cosmi-Rod she’s holding is very reminiscent of his in both GotG and Captain Marvel. The Kree soldier behind her is sporting similar armor to Ronan’s as well. <a href=#>#TheMarvels</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Om39hyIqJf</a></p>— anna | mourning L to the OG (@misc_convos) <a href=#>April 11, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>Having such a politically powerful character, and one <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who’s no doubt powerful in a physical sense too</a>, opposing Carol Danvers and her new allies, Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani) and Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris), will hopefully mean we’re in for a thrilling confrontation come The Marvels. What’s more, however Dar-Benn is adapted, let’s hope she has the opportunity to return. It would be fun if Ashton could one day share the screen with her real-life partner, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Loki himself Tom Hiddleston</a>.</p><p data-characters=56 data-current-count=56 data-injectable=false>The Marvels is set to blast into theaters this Nov. 10.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGnXZ7AbsbAsJxmmaOdwbC6jKmjmrGZo7Rutc1mq6GdXaKus8LEpapmoJWneq7F0q2cq7FdorC2edWio6WZmaN6psTPpZiippWZfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toby-dobrik-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-24486-html.html><span>←</span><span>Toby Dobrik Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
