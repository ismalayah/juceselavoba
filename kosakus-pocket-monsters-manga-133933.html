Unlike the more popular and famed series such as Special, Pocket Monsters is vastly different being chiefly a gag manga that follows the never ending journeys of Isamu Akai and his idiotic, rude Clefairy, more capable Pikachu, and for a time, his Tyrogue as well.</p><p>Basically, this series: <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FPok%25C3%25A9mon_Pocket_Monsters&hash=447f918c1809ea4ed83dc9b2ea2276fd" rel="nofollow noopener">Pokémon Pocket Monsters - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia</a></p><p>Pocket Monsters, in my opinion, is genius. I love gag manga, even the ones that are profane since I personally find profanity to be hilarious, and I especially love how Kosaku had interpreted the Pokemon differently in his drawings. Even Rattata looking like a generic cartoon mouse is amusing to me.</p><p>I can't say however that I really like the newer series of the manga though, especially starting with the RSE series. The Pokemon were then depicted a little more "official", probably to appeal to more audiences, and the art style overall seems quite different. Clefairy looks different and more "square'ish", and Pikachu looks like... Pikachu. I definitely prefer the older art style of the manga's Gen I days.</p><p>Unfortunately, as much as I like to call myself a 'fan' of the manga, I have not read a single page of it, but if I had a chance, then yes I definitely would. Unfortunately my household doesn't like the idea of online ordering, so it's not like I can purchase the English editions from Singapore, and I also wouldn't want the series to be licensed for North American release because then the manga would be butchered by edits and censors. But at least I can admire the series for what it is and how different it is compared to other Pokemon manga.</p><p>Anyway, this thread is for discussion of the awesomely amazing Pocket Monsters manga, whether you love it or hate it (which I'm sure applies to the majority of fans). Discuss~</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHysu9Kaoq6rXaW8pLfErWSmp56owaa%2B0makmqaXlntyf5Jyamxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-one-piece-anime-characters-too-impossible-for-the-live-action-series.html><span>←</span><span>10 One Piece anime characters too impossible for the live-action series</span></a>
