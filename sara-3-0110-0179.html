Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me 'bout the fireDrowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me homeAnd he was just like a great dark wing"><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In the opening lines, the singer asks their former lover to stay with them for just a little while longer, as they had promised to provide light but never mentioned the fire that would eventually consume them both. The image of drowning in a sea of love is both powerful and poignant, as it represents the desire to completely surrender oneself to another person. The singer laments the loss of this intimacy, but ultimately expresses a willingness to reconcile and start over anew, “when you build your house, then call me home.”</p><br><p>The middle section of the song introduces a new character, referred to as “he,” who may represent the source of the conflict that ended the singer’s relationship. This man is compared to a dark wing within the wings of a storm, suggesting he has a destructive influence on those around him. The singer feels as though they have finally met their match, but his undoing of their laces feels like a metaphor for the way he broke down their defenses and left them vulnerable.</p><br><p>The final section of the song finds the singer holding out hope that their former lover will come back to them, even as they acknowledge that things may never be the same. The repeated refrain of “Sara” serves as a kind of anchor, perhaps a reminder of the intimacy they once shared, or a plea for the other person to remember the bond they had.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Wait a minute, baby</u><br>Hold on, give me some time.</p><br><p><u>Stay with me awhile</u><br>Don't leave me, stay here with me for some time.</p><br><p><u>Said you'd give me light</u><br>You promised to bring happiness and light into my life.</p><br><p><u>But you never told me 'bout the fire</u><br>But you didn't warn me about the danger and pain that comes with it.</p><br><p><u>Drowning in the sea of love</u><br>Overwhelmed by the intensity of love.</p><br><p><u>Where everyone would love to drown</u><br>A state of love that everyone desires to experience.</p><br><p><u>But now it's gone</u><br>But that love has faded away.</p><br><p><u>It doesn't matter what for</u><br>The reason for its disappearance is not important.</p><br><p><u>When you build your house</u><br>When you finally settle down and start a family.</p><br><p><u>Then call me home</u><br>Invite me to your home and let me be part of your life.</p><br><p><u>And he was just like a great dark wing</u><br>He was like a powerful, mysterious force.</p><br><p><u>Within the wings of a storm</u><br>In the midst of intense emotions and conflict.</p><br><p><u>I think I had met my match, he was singing</u><br>I thought I had found someone who was my equal and who understood me.</p><br><p><u>And undoing, and undoing the laces</u><br>But he was also causing me pain and undoing the fabric of our relationship.</p><br><p><u>Said Sara, you're the poet in my heart</u><br>He praised her for being the muse of his creativity and inspiration.</p><br><p><u>Never change, never stop</u><br>He wanted her to remain constant and continue to inspire him.</p><br><p><u>Hold on</u><br>Wait, don't go.</p><br><p><u>The night is coming and the starling flew for days</u><br>The darkness is approaching, and time is passing quickly.</p><br><p><u>I'll stay home at night, all the time</u><br>I will sacrifice and dedicate my time to you.</p><br><p><u>I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere</u><br>I'm willing to go anywhere in the world for you.</p><br><p><u>Ask me and I'm there, yeah</u><br>Just tell me what you need, and I'll be there for you.</p><br><p><u>In the sea of love</u><br>In the overwhelming intensity of love.</p><br><p><u>But now it's gone</u><br>But that love has faded away.</p><br><p><u>They say it doesn't matter anymore</u><br>People are saying that it's not important anymore.</p><br><p><u>If you build your house</u><br>When you finally settle down and start a family.</p><br><p><u>Then please call me home</u><br>Invite me to be part of your life, and let us build a home together.</p><br><p><u>Sara, you're the poet in my heart</u><br>She will always be the muse of his creativity and inspiration.</p><br><p><u>Never change, and don't you ever stop</u><br>He loves her just the way she is and wants her to keep inspiring him.</p><br><p><u>Now it's gone</u><br>But that love has faded away.</p><br><p><u>No it doesn't matter anymore</u><br>It's not important anymore why the love has disappeared.</p><br><p><u>When you build your house</u><br>When you finally settle down and start a family.</p><br><p><u>I'll come by</u><br>He still wants to be part of her life and visit her new home.</p><br><p><u>Sara</u><br>Recalling her name with affection and longing for the past.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd.<br>Written by: Stevie Nicks</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maH6cmrK1w86om5iFkZh8lK3RmpZha1VlfnJ8hGlocHFZ</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miss-blythe-scandal-everything-to-know-about-the-viral-twitter-video.html><span>←</span><span>Miss Blythe Scandal: Everything To Know About The Viral Twitter Video</span></a>
